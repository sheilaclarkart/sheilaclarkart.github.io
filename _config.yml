  Iâ€™ve had a passion for making things as far back as I can remember, discovering a particular passion for painting and sketching the prairie landscape, flowers, birds and nature.

Over the last few years I've been creating textile art pieces, sewing one of a kind ruffled aprons, bags, dresses, etc., perfecting my quilting skills, knitting and cross stitching.

My most recent ventures are as a result of our move to beautiful Vancouver Island.  I find all kinds of beautiful pieces of sea glass and pottery on the beaches, so I just have to create jewellery out of these gifts from the sea.
The sea and all her beautiful, wild, shores has lured me to paint and draw.

Thank you for visiting my site and I hope you enjoy looking at my gallery.
