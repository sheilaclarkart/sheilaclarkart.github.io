description: <p>I've had a passion for making things as far back as I can remember, discovering a particular passion for painting and sketching the prairie landscape, flowers, birds and nature.</p><p>Over the last few years I've been creating textile art pieces, sewing one of a kind ruffled aprons, bags, dresses, etc., perfecting my quilting skills, knitting and cross stitching.</p><p>My most recent ventures are as a result of our move to beautiful Vancouver Island. I find all kinds of beautiful pieces of seaglass and pottery on the beaches, so I just have to create jewellery out of these gifts from the sea.</p><p>The sea and all her beautiful, wild, shores has lured me to paint and draw.</p><p>Thank you for visiting my site and I hope you enjoy looking at my gallery.</p>
